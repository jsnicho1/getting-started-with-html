<b>Fundamentals of the Internet:</b><br>
<p>The Internet is a global network of interconnected computers. Computers make file requests via <em>web servers
</em>through the <em>http protocol.</em>The server then sends the requested document or file back to the user.
<em>Browsers</em> then render the webpage by dispaying the underlying code, most likely <em>html.</em>
 </p>
<b>HTML:</b>
<br>
<br>
<p>HTML stands for <em>hyper text markup language.</em> It is the basic "language" of the web.
HTML is made of text and tags which together form the content and appearance of a webpage 
(along with other coding technologies). Web Developers use HTML to construct web pages by programming the computer to
execute the exact instructions given to it. In this way, computers are 'dumb,' by which we mean they 
demand precise code in order to render desired outcomes- like embedding silly videos such as
